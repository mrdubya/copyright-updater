*copyright-updater.txt*	Copyright notice year updater.

Copyright (c) 2023-2025 Mike Williams <mrmrdubya@gmail.com>

A plugin to automatically update the year in Copyright notice in a modified
file.

==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION						*copyr-intro*

This plugin will automatically update the year in Copyright notices for
specific Copyright owners. This is based on VIM tip #1521:

https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Automatically_Update_Copyright_Notice_in_Files

The plugin recognises the following examples of Copyright notice: >

	Copyright 1999 Fred Bloggs, All rights reserved.
	Copyright (C) 1999 Fred Bloggs, All rights reserved.
	Copyright (c) 1999-2005 Fred Bloggs
<
Whenever a modified file is written, the year of publication will be updated
with the current year if it is different. The year can be updated with a year
range or just a single year.

When updating a year range and only one year is listed then it is changed to
YYYY-<current year>, if two years are listed and the second year is not this
year then the second year is updated to this year.

When updating with just the current year it will replace both a single year
and a year range with the current year.

The plugin is setup by telling it which Copyright owners to update the notice
for. This prevents accidentally updating Copyright notices from other owners
that may be present in the file.

To setup Copyright notice updating add a call to either
`copyright#UpdateEndYearFor()` or `copyright#UpdateYearFor()` to your
`.vimrc`/`_vimrc` file. For example: >

	:call copyright#UpdateYearFor('Fred Bloggs')
<
Add as many Copyright owners as needed to the call with a list of Copyright
owner names.
