*copyright-updater.txt*	Copyright notice year updater.

Copyright (c) 2023 Mike Williams <mrmrdubya@gmail.com>

A plugin to automatically update the year in Copyright notice in a modified
file.

==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION						*copyr-intro*

This plugin will automatically update the year in Copyright notices for
specific Copyright owners. This is based on VIM tip #1521.

The plugin recognises the following examples of Copyright notice: >

	Copyright 1999 Fred Bloggs, All rights reserved.
	Copyright (C) 1999 Fred Bloggs, All rights reserved.
	Copyright (c) 1999-2005 Fred Bloggs
<
Whenever a file that has been modified is written then the year of publication
is updated to include the current year if it is different. If only one year is
listed then it is changed to YYYY-<current year>, if two years are listed and
the second year is not this year then the second year is updated to this year.

The plugin is setup by telling it which Copyright owners to update the notice
for. This prevents accidentally updating Copyright notices from other owners
that may be present in the file.

To setup updating a Copyright notice add a call to `copyright#UpdateFor()` to
your `.vimrc`/`_vimrc` file as follows: >

	:call copyright#UpdateFor('Fred Bloggs')
<
Add as many Copyright owners as needed to the call.

==============================================================================
